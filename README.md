# DECI project-2

## Description
DECI project-2 is a project which you can go through sections and add comments dynamically

## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/myhandgg/DECI-project2.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory `cd DECI-project2`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage
the functionality is to create a comment

1. the first loop is looping over all the sections and put it into unordered list

2. on scroll we compare the y axis to know which section is currently active
 = and the removeActive function removes every active class and put it into the current one

3. the createComment function makes a comment with the name, email and description of the user
4. on submit we check if any of the inputs are invalid and if so, we show an error message
